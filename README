A template repository for deploying Lambda functions to AWS using a Github Action

Requires some Repository Variables to be set on the repository, which should be handled
by the TF module

Requires AWS auth to be configured (ideally via OIDC, but actions secrets would work as well, the yaml would need to be modified).

Broadly does the following:

# Get the bucket name from TF output
aws s3 cp lambda_function.zip s3://S3_BUCKET/

# same, function name too
aws lambda update-function-code  --function-name FUNCTION_NAME  --s3-bucket S3_BUCKET --s3-key lambda_function.zip
